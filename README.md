AlignMyBoat is a fork of triphora's [Orientation](https://modrinth.com/mod/orientation) mod which in itself is a fork of TheCritic's [Critical Orientation](https://github.com/bshuler/critical-orientation/tree/master) mod. I have rewritten the mod and translated it back to fabric with hopes of keeping it updated to modern versions (although Mojang and FabricMC sure isn't making that easy)

Pressing the keybind will snap your camera angle to a multiple of 45 degrees. Change the keybind in settings if you so wish.
